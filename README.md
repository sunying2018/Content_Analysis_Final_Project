## The Analysis of Medium Articles
Ying Sun

Medium is one of the most famous platforms for spreading knowledge about almost any field. It provides readers with quality, original ideas, clean reading experience and engagement. Particularly, it is widely used to published articles on ML, AI and data science.
In this project I collect the data of 337 medium articles in these three fields spanning from 2000 to present and I use this data to answer the following questions: how to write a good article in these fields? How to inform the reader in an interesting way? What sort of title attracts more crowd? How long an article should be? What are content features of these articles?

### Data Source:
Medium articles tagged under ML, AI and data science

### Note on Scripy script
Run scripy.py in python 3 and type the tags you need
sperated by space.
